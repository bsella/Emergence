# Building Emergence
For now, Emergence is supported only on the GNU/Linux system. To build it you will need `cmake` and the `Qt5Widgets` library.

It's highly recommended to build out of the source directory. For example, type the following commands:

    $ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make
